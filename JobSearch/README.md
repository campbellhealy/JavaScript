## Job Searching App

I followed a tutorial to run through this initially.
Wiped the slate clean and built the app myself.

Added in an extra folder JObSearch, this has 3 bat files.
jobsearch.bat
    This is the control file and double click should get everything running
    This terminal window will close once everything is up and running.
server.bat
    The back end request server that listens for the inputs of Title and Location.
    This terminal window will minimise when active.

webserver.bat
    This is the frontend and build the index.html. Note on the first run, the browser will open before the build is complete.
    A refresh or two should sort this.
    This terminal window will minimise when active. (You can look at this to see when the index is built)
    
If there are any issues then it will relate to the version of Node, I have user v15. Otherwise it may need some package installs.
Look in the package files for details of those I nedded.
