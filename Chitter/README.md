# Chitter (chitter)

A Quasar Framework app
I built this front end from a complete tutorial that would utilise Firebase.
Not wanting to do anything other than learn the front.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).

Note: node_modules folder is not included, it is just too large and best to be built at the time of app creation
